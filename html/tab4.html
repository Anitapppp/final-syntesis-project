    <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
    <p>This second part of the project must be done individual.
      For each plot, you must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your information is true.

    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>

    <p>
        In the first graph we can see the KWh consumption data in five months, each with its respective expenditure, in this case the X axis represents each of the months and the Y axis represents consumption, that is, the KWh spent, the red dots shown in the graph are the exact amount spent in each of the months, these points are scattered throughout the graph. Taking into account all these data you can see how from the first month to the second month there is a decrease, that is to say that in the second month there was less consumption than in the first, but from the second to the third month there is a large increase so it can be intuited that in the third month there was much more spending than in the first and second,of the third fourth and fifth there is a significant decrease so the third month was where many more KWh were consumed.

        Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
        syntax in order to compute that.

    <p>
        $$ y=-0.80 \cdot 6 + 131.00 $$ $$ y=126.2 \text {kWh} $$
    </p> 
    <b><li>
      Conclusion 
    </li></b>
    <p>
        In conclusion, you can see the different consumption of KWh in recent months, being 154 KWh is higher consumption, belonging to the month of February and the lowest being 117 KWh in April; According to the linear regression and the given equation,it is expected that for the following month the consumption will be 126.2 KWh, which would be a great variation in the graph,Since it would take a big leap upwards, this being the second largest consumption presented.All this makes us understand that we must assume much more responsibility to take care of energy consumption in our homes and thus take care of the environment.

        <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
    <div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>

    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <ul>
    <b><li>Analysis</li></b>
    <p>
        The graph in comparison with the first one that was presented to us, relates the number of people living in a house with the total KWh consumption in the last month, with the X axis being the variable of the residents and the Y axis the total. of consumption, it can be seen that the red dots refer to the 10 data that are presented, these are located in the number of people living in the house, these are located on the X axis for the number of residents and on the Y axis for the total consumption, it can be seen that the highest consumption was 475 KWh with 7 residents and the lowest was 79 with 3 residents. According to the linear regression, it can be identified that it is an increasing graph, since as the y-axis grows, the X-axis also grows, this is because the less people live in the house, the less consumption there is and the more people residing in the house, the more consumption will be obtained.
    </br>
    The equation that is given to us helps us to know how much the linear regression will go up or down according to the data that we want to know, in this case it helps us to calculate how much the consumption of a residential unit where 200 people live, the total consumption will be 11413.16 KWh.

    <b><li>
      Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
      people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li></b>
      
    <p>
      $$ y=57.29 \cdot 200 + (-44.84) $$ $$ y=11413.16 \text { kWh} $$
    </p>
      
    <b><li>
     Conclusion 
    </li></b>
    <p>
      In conclusion it can be said that in this graph the more the number of people who live in a house increases, the consumption of total KWh also increases, it can be evidenced that it is much more common to find a family of 2-3 residents to a family of 7 residents, from the formula that was given, I was able to show how much is spent on a unit with 200 people,But in itself it is not known how much each of them spends, so relatively to be so many people you do not make such a large consumption.
