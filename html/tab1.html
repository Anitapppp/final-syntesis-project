  <h5>
    Electric energy:
  </h5>
  <p>
    is the energy derived from electric potential energy or kinetic energy of
    the charged particles. In general, it is referred to as the energy that has
    been converted from electric potential energy.

  <h5>
    Watt (physical unit):
  </h5>
  <p>
    The watt (symbol: W) is the unit of power in the International System of
    Units. Its value indicates the amount of electrical energy measured in
    joules that is converted, used or dissipated in one second.

  <h5>
    Scatter Plot:
  </h5>
  <p>
    is a set of points plotted on horizontal and vertical axes. Scatter plots
    are important in statistics because they can show the extent of correlation,
    if any, between the values of observed quantities or phenomena (called
    variables).

  <h5>
    Linear regression:
  </h5>
  <p>
    Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based
    on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called
    the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other
    variable's value is called the independent variable.

  <h5>
    Renewable energy:
  </h5>
  <p>
    is energy derived from natural sources that is replenished at a higher rate
    than it is consumed. An example of these sources are, for example, sunlight
    and wind; these sources are continually renewed. Renewable energy sources
    are abundant and all around us.
