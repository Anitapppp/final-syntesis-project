<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>

    Linear regression models provide a mathematical formula for interpretation to generate predictions. Linear regression is an established technique and is easily applied to software and computing. In this first graph we can observe the data in the last 5 months regarding the amount of KWh consumed in each of the months, the points that are observed in red color represent the exact data each one in front of its determined values, we can observe that each one of the points are very dispersed respect to the fact that one is very high and the other very low, they are not linear, this is due to the variation of the consumption. From the first and third month we can say that the consumption is in a very similar range, but the red point of the second month is very high and if we analyze the graph we can see that it is the point located higher with respect to the x-axis, so that in this period of time month two was where more kWh of energy was spent.  
    The fourth month increased very little compared to the third month and in the last month the consumption was lower compared to the other months. 
</br>
</br>
    In relation to the linear regression, the gray line that is evident in the graph, is decreasing since this is a graphical adjustment of the same information, it is also used to predict the value of a variable according to the value of another. For example, at the end of the graph the page shows an equation with the exact data used to calculate forecasts. The variable to be predicted is called the dependent variable, and the variable used to predict the value of the next variable is called the independent variable.

    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.

  <p>
    $$ y=-4.80 \cdot 6 + 230.60 $$ $$ y=201.8 \text {kWh} $$

    Conclusion 
  </li></b>

  <p>
      I can conclude from the graph that there is a large variation in energy kWh consumption in the last 5 months, but most of the values obtained are in the range of 213 to 237 kWh, but in the current month (April) it dropped significantly to 197 kWh, compared to the lowest value in the first month, decreasing 16 points. According to the linear regression and the equation with the data, it is expected that for the following month the consumption will be 201.8 kWh.  The idea is to consume as little energy as possible to take care of the planet, since consuming less can help us reduce the impact and combat the effects of global warming and climate change.

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <b><li>Analysis</li></b>
  <p>
      This graph in comparison with the first graph, relates the number of people living in a house with the kWh they consume in the last month and were exposed 10 data located throughout the graph. On the x-axis, variables of residents, from a range of 2 to 7 people and on the y-axis,it starts from 100 to 500 kWh of energy, it can be observed that when 2 and 4 people live there are two red dots in each one, representing the two amounts of consumption in a month that is spent when that number of people live, but when 3 people live, the diagram shows 4 red dots indicating the amount of kWh they consumed in the month of April, that number of residents was the most common in the survey, when 5 and 7 people live there is only one dot because there is only one family composed of 5 people and another of 7, and in the data collected there is no family with 6 members, so there is no dot there. From 2 to 5 with respect to the x-axis, the consumption does not vary much, it is in the range of 116 to 267 kWh, but when 7 people live, the consumption for one month is too high, with a value of 475 kWh. 
  </br>
  </br>
      The gray line, the linear regression that is a graphical adjustment of the same information, it can be seen that it is growing for both the y-axis and the x-axis, this is because the fewer people living in a house the less kWh of energy consumed, and if the number of people increases the consumption will also increase, for example the equation below the graph, can help us to know when the linear regression will go down or up depending on what you want to find, then we will show how many kWh will be consumed if the consumption of 200 people in a residential unit is calculated. The graph grows notably by the variable 475 on the y-axis, with respect to 7 on the x-axis.

</ul>
  
  <b><li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li></b>

  <p>
    $$ y=58.12 \cdot 200 + (-4.32) $$ $$ y=11619.68 \text { kWh} $$
  </p>

  <b><li>
      Conclusion 
    </li></b>
  <p>
      I can conclude from this graph that the more the number of people living in a house increases, the amount of energy kWh consumption in a single month will also increase, it can be evidenced that it is much more common that a family consists of 3 people than 7, the linear regression is a line that determines the relationship between the dependent and independent variable, relating the different equation according to the data provided, it could also be observed that in a residential unit, thanks to the equation that defines its independent variable which is what we already know and the dependent variable that will be found using the respective formula, we will be able to predict how much x people will consume.
