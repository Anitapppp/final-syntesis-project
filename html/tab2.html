<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>

      Linear regression models provide a mathematical formula that can be interpreted and thus generate predictions. It is an established statistical technique that is applied to computer programs and in computer science. It attempts to plot a linear graph between two variables, as in this case the variable X represents months and the variable Y represents kWh. 
      As can be seen in the graph, the linear regression is descending on the Y axis with respect to the passage of the months located on the X axis, since observing the equation it can be seen that the slope is negative 2.00, so that when X increases by 1, Y decreases by 2.00 and the Y-intercept is 126.80. On the other hand, the red points represent the kWh consumption of the household in each month, which allows us to determine that in comparison from the first to the second month, consumption increased, but for the third month it remained stable with respect to the previous month, while for the fourth and fifth month it decreased significantly.
